i think the u. n. h. l. and now he's asked centel and hold the impression you folks in and economists are nationals of the way of life chaining attaches now makes after weeks of movies books online that means i can only stand by however as foreseen in the teens in the events of the house yet on another book which is coming out next year old monique globalize to the hathaway's mission will he changed that he can any chance at leinsdorf the medicate aimal city coalesced though but now all and i directed a box of you sees the hoffa conceding education does that mean to cost course is getting on line forces that affect on race or enough or line courses under the but ultimately you know is that presents a couple inch my mission bookseller under globalization i think he has made some testing that tremendous yaron even on the one of things past that we ought to happen the mounties holocaust in which its financial so the harassment when austere of hamas and the sun and mortgage crisis in the united states we began to take hold in amherst and senate was it costs the area north of rock which generated the first time crime on the british pound in that since then of course seasonally confidant who are sent in marshes this year we had the current era there sharon's which was force injury silky case work in chains century marks the start of the prospect of standing on its yeah at this home in with the collapse of the renaissance at ten fifteen i have roughly braces to wear aaronson thank chance in the financial crisis the question probably also so no sign just a we'll listen this is january eighteenth was in court the credit crunch there is just not lending coming out of it by secondhand which has three other patients for this is he had individuals and companies and and i think it's the challenge that faced all along with more on the pounds yes i i agree with that setting the finger at laying the prices that vestibule surplus with the systematic and united nations in nineteen nineties removing the requirements of all banks to hold off a metal zippers out to when they sell the golden i was a successful build a society that's when the get go and start mr bush today senseless she should wear people but in my intent to say that men do acknowledge that to borrow i said this and he he should they share of the building societies that they would set video justify it by any economical or moral and he meant that it probably did ah the current members of those socks they now the value that we should be built up that i have the ace in the decades that whole profited of the individual comebacks in consultants who are looking at i think you're hunting for a deregulation of the beach and they the bill would have beaten that that build up of such an unsustainable refutes the boom which left that to the state i think he's sending the end of wall street has learned that british car and then on i can i just past the this is a lot of work the same bank analysts sound that it's a very unusual senate only withdrawn the nineteen thirties now is one of the hand with this crisis is not who is the front page to fashion banking sector fell years or five really calm down term global i want to be interesting things which course cannot take the great depression was across the line in the united states went to see it was in safeguarding the counter closed its own way harming forests and essentially separated two it was in any way the out on wall street tends in and invest in bonds which hatfield's nonbinding causes but overnight lending short term money on the night wanting to feel some money on and of course with deregulation the eighties nineties wall street really i think the clintons since you really flourished on the fact all of this san juan if things that you could come about now is found these investment banks no longer it's it's most prominent ones called tax on working families they now become normal bank owned and sadness because it crosses hands also the cousin nineteen ninety it cost the launch was abolished sanctioning and legislation the united states in that instance concurrent in the air including eighteen times and the counting team functions they had to start flashing eyes and then i think what we're what went on how it was found when they can't have we were looking at senator thank you found him which could go round the end time credits is that institutions they concentrate investment sanctions at home page of the scheme devers gwen and not suffer from the time so in that sense i suppose that whole amount of time to do something about the crisis in the interest we think what happens is institutional we're really now assumption is they have right now in the places i insist that no indications of what's happened is very important because it but i think these ads on the financial sector that the system is quite different all the senses a high street shops or cops there was a west is where the one copy to back up to nato not to listen to take up the ia where is with nasa sets out of it basket maturation how unethical the whole of vetoing wishes of course wanted them but the british had been endowments have stepped well to say faxon also much because that particular company meet the same didn't not to be like that don't yet you chose companies in america is that not all the facts of the aisle want the as soon that the problem is we've the whole incident speculation settled innovation invention you that show up our city traded in a rather plenty of the gains from inventions the presence of long election huge increase in the hostel bonuses being out of power by the he speculates the problem is that's infuriating of all i think well if that individual rokahr is successful in profit permits them you say to the computer bancroft and so on in this case where this these systematic indications of fayette dollars they they they're not able to let the the process in effect the big gains in being a privatized it to the individual companies privately that the risks of being socialized if the taxpayer who's left taxpayers i mean to the topeka the time that he cheated ten civilians were more than i sell i think can you quantify the trial hurts the note from wednesday there's a savvy he's this crisis came from the united i'm not i think there is something we're still about the way that tended patients he and his cast and then he said much more home grown but i think by and i recognize that problem perhaps in my view was to sign the more interviews on the and we know that these massive boroff passages in fact the u. s. army u. k. have the kind of stuff you principles one is that capitalize haitian the british government came on this much more quickly in the american to raise the on the crew to use a course for our times the banks and these lines he found he was inclined down these talks if that's the trouble of assets they are essentially short of and that the government has extended to them guarantees of mountain ridge in haiti mounted this is try to assure that credit crunch doesn't end resulted in losses have c.'s mortgage for parishioners said the suspects taken so long by british government anti americans were slightly different finishing the day of one to the top two lines they were more and how did you troubled assets is called hard time but camaguey famously you can and this may decide not to fire that's now those in this interesting i think from watching it starts how is the act that the question now is is that something the russians are american governments are going to have to seriously yeah despite a fifteen billion pound recapitalize haitian prime time and nearly a minute to the critique he extended to the banking system that banks say they're not in position to they're still shoring up their balance sheets so what that's suggesting is they still come right down sitcom from the travel time that's what we have seen sinful i may only be right down to the so called credit to run into cities and haiti instruments but if it was so collateralized that obligation sent another words would jan really secure a time assets so assets which are traded on the basis of some crime or did would you then become secure ties in trade is that instruments those are still out there all found she and if those are not written down by banks and then banks themselves take whatever happened to her and clinton there is the teacher shocked about it she said he's the land and we are still in credit crunch despite the billions being poured christians in the crown today about whether or not they have the sheik in the banks even warned to resolve the current crimes i think that slyly when this is the key point which is what is going to happen to these troubled assets we know that he had on the books is pat has sanctioned in an nineteen nineties they didn't really removed from the conscience of pennsylvania thanks for watching three of you know kind of breast implants but we know that when i'm seles has sent me down the fifty five challenge in the moment he's clearly british government now to put toppers invasion the tendency to for students and to drive counties and that that's in session in they only turkey shares lost its banks by rolling i have sat there and positioned to keep the final resting on it as reading who practice common is that this is said that the light off regulation that they're being said he said to those the backs of the rosty is that the new light touch relational wasn't saw such russia now to see that it is less in warsaw because unlike in the previous radiated you know faxes investigations were brought to hold the set of proportion of the masses to back off letting you do the banks russia's he schundler in effect able to his grave is susan you money on themselves might they not that it's a fashion shows checking that they really well jan the assets that is the a lot of ceases by that i mean i see actually they were you when students in my yeah i think had he had a lawyer there i am only siren son had a sudden my world should be behind henhouse of the penny to regulate case not asking hard questions my technicians new action had indeed found is something that's scientifically true peace i found it so i think i i think putting a financial crisis toward off not easy the house with an eye also think we need to do it in real economy in faxing is one of the ways in fact happened is the hottest current assets of over steamer financial crisis in another not to deal with the aztecs numeric on in the last sentence in a crash in nineteen policy to lay a hand just can't have problem becomes of the yukon problem and i know they shot and has undertaken now tomorrow a rock courtroom and today she trying to sound too yeah at the intersection which isn't at all and it could bite you going to pass the government spending borrowing and she's something like a trillion pounds and thanks to use national guard to keep it here and she i'm in twenty five to p twenty two key at some fifty seven percent of g. now higher as you think this was to death with the singer is the average tax you can ratios sixty and inside a change and monumental because it still is just the other countries like italy house denson eurasia is that a hundred it does any using this day as ansa said i'll be out of self misstatement bring down because they're no one year to levels which is the two hundred percent at five to eighty and the moment but i think that what gold is borrowing is intended to do of course is to try to get really back on track and the fiscal stimulus part of course is centered on a few things to all these candidates like a kind taxes one case in the key yacht tax credits and things into their warranty and it also of course the the eighteen kind that you would just hand it to you and many in chief concern how to stay and the crime in a sense for the a. t. has come under quite a bit criticism because those people in five percent cut in the eighties they not and she left she ratchet reischauer bounce them less i was i'm glad about the plan was sandtown it's announced it last forty years in the affirmation that she is saying he may eighteenth he may want to thank you say to fastening nine instead of twenty ten twenty because i got to sin now and said i am not be sent us this thing in the antique car is probably on the schools on that and i she worrying that the stimulus i mean that's that's an easy on him which he can hold onto that paid yes and there are numbered important issues there are seven of the the key to the killing was cutbacks in the talks here in cases of the sudden i thought geez when it las vegas long test of slovo she should of the heat on question if the government of boris action be so you should go around by by the end to spend one thing that problem on the who knows it has no effect it's a it's a bum well this policy and the the the the debt said i'm not saying you would however if the economy's in recession rocked and wally's resources and factories and florida where to the goal of larussa the million times and spends it to do which is rather suspect that comes out to organize 'em i'm not a factor boosting only by two million times that so they did in fact history he's the detective not think of so it is very difficult united you call mexico or post allison that a full what the ethics of increasing or a movie on the racial origin actually cut off the the key question then is to try tonics the bloody war of aways that will accede to use vastly co and so the blue jays who borrowed too much income i have said in culture in question and the weather causing aids i was the best way of doing that i think it's a difficult question but some eye to death in cairo today that the only cuts in the secret to how sensitive questions and she went up fifteen voters will not make enough food to those fifty to the current climate of this comeback monopoly christmas shopping where prices the stock but could set the example of securities that will last as you know the shelters is that the shelves presents i put that sample size that should offset suh a maid on making much difference hospitalizations and when did the couple's money into this because they cost of being seen on until that do this alone that you were gonna benefit of cost grosses businesses to police this is jane do it prices enough changeable factor in these times selloff so i had the press in a hunting lodge a five cent cut in including one who has eluded as it was passed in the best of using that twelve and also on a diet to mention matches as ansa disdainful to pay more in the states but also as the the rest of package didn't they needed reforms would fuel pavements that matches and so alicia talking will have a bigger bets are in fact the movies the house indeed on to thrash out the scar trees because the e. inquires the teaching awful long time telling consensus kind of eases the pain abounds in that kind of still loafers that you're kinda of the case is certainly not just the u. it's still said no efforts have been put forward at the european union have full time to time to you this and i think the economic rationale for it is quite good and this is something the u. k. and the chagrin and sent me out of haiti which is when you push on the and that spending goes home he wants so they actually it's a country that sounds to or he's going to have fiscal stimulus into slashing policy convictions this kind of not spending will send fallen team yet you're exports and say it's not it's a void may take to on march eighth policy boost to the countries which of course has a much larger world countries washington is not and when the interest of fossils found so she was there and he ended up in that he isn't this isn't effect on the banks soon with any similar zena and i he was out in bankruptcy court and that is a sense that the government's taking arms and you and say that in the image i counted five the man who shot and some incentive and banks on corruption cases that course in that incident has not been found to the short lived t. thousands have involves the actual amount of asked me the job and that's why i think that banks twenty i don't think you do this hand and then real concern here is creating what happens on scene and businesses insurance passed on at the christian movement that study that the real reason his latin i'm just need that action the credit to him through city care units on for instance i heard that croons has had to call bankruptcy because i crunch have a space in the headlines you cited of this tonya's lollis who was shot down after nineteen eighty years of their eyes as i would question whether or not it's there it's an autocratic control additive some people find that move was found and shops that has caused it turn to was yes it is not a good sign each on slopes of the the crises that are out necessary popped a cap of developments this do you want my view the mission well to sell off violent and that helped so the recovery in home with outside matches if you look at the becomes the the degree of bankrupt amid recessions the result that it's affecting home less than that there's only been well maybe the media just one successful than a mecca companies that they're about as i was you can see it in very successful who essentially of that companies that do you just had a withdrawal of a collapse of the reason would have prodi go to a successful company says it is very costly process of this issue of profited from i'll just back to the cause but also to drool all credential when the providers of asia it is strange that the government's spent so much a task that money buying shares in the backs of the extent that there that nationalize the dozens of the debate on television that the banks are paying pro life and yet many it middleton the banks that was doolittle running backs in in that some countries interest that is nils is it a bit of insects that doesn't have experience in and the noxious teaches at banks as well as other foreigners ages of all seen you last season and authorities some hospital that is you've years about the employer will that well well match for the public sector rules and i mean that was not a man who sees the roman public sector a sense is that you did sell those of the plants accept banks in britain that have of who i think that it will produce right now that the house will of the government should be doing with the banks that they nineteen of making sure that they be given to people on the boards of austin questions when shipp as we know is not the a lot of go yeah but they said the u. s. is such a vote to regulate that was about to go questions that that it people don't give it to impossible to have osuch russians huntoon that's what it is provided said to companies for productive use indeed economy has opposed to a vote of civil speculation which is a cop and a girl she i worry that if they don't wickets the unemployment rise dramatically as the economy goes to the kids hash the government's hand projections for its fighting for its caught in his hand the u. k. and can round second if haitians package antenna the last sentence if the global picture is worth ten tons in time the checks for estimations for all said and we're in worse there are any which would mean well while in the next six months and you could see the teens he arrived home at animals in selma

counties cities questions we have sent him and i'm not so for all crimes says yes that is the danger of of being stuck in low tones sasha employment policies didn't have a we take it back the time that sees that the sounds of the talk is free and absolute analysis to be inching away came storming hurricanes is being amused dollars in the i mean it that politicians that because of this outpost in the borrowing to try a staple of which is indeed more than skate said that you could do that is more often that supply which is that the the countess ecosystem is self right thing is just not when textbooks of the day said that exchange for a week or so of points in that wish them the father to be restored and as i was the he could indeed get stock in the mall some recession with with the setting that doesn't expectancy is lay out any sitting with interest rates in the media through we use cases by injuries not happy about how i did that to nonetheless it's not doing the cover much of the seven states in a production to one ah but evasive saying as well that the mafia is the u. k. government spends it backed the great the type decision they start to kind of response to differences raise tobacco being now ron dellums also say that i was told it's about the media pool he's lost decatur hallway when looking back i should say this to do to it is the only solution and doctor interest rates that we have the discipline that that in this room that the one time it came to this decision i want to do that i think he knew and yet interest rates fossey well i have lost the most

talked in nineteen ninety one yeah i was jose difficult to know whether or not the independence of the center and was responsible for not only strong though inflation and shades for that outer sheath day and on other oman haitians who want hounds but i suspect the main problem with this crisis without finding her and i'm just in the regulatory at the center and usually serves as well as the united washing so i sent my policy addresses rosen join conference idea has had an interest in south orange uniform regulate care yeah treasury and i think one of the list challenge when and down and i said
