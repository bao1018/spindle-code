## Introduction

Welcome to the SPINDLE project code repository. This repository contains two main folders:
- **keywords**: this directory contains keywords.py. Keywords.py is a python script developed during the SPINDLE project [[blog] (http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/openspires/category/spindle/)] [[website](http://openspires.oucs.ox.ac.uk/spindle/)] that generates keywords from a text. 
It has been used during the [project] (http://openspires.oucs.ox.ac.uk/spindle/) project to [generate keywords
 from automatic transcriptions] (http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/openspires/2012/09/12/spindle-automatic-keyword-generation-step-by-step/).
